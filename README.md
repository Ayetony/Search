Search
======

<p>A searcher with SSH based on Lucene</p>
<p>I was going to run this searcher on Hadoop, however, I found that I can't achieve the Search Algorithm in Parallel Computing. All I can do is rewrite the steps of building Index instead of Alogorithm in Map/Reduce.</p>
<p>I almost find the solution but I was confused by the sea of Abstract class and Interface. It's a MESSSSSSSSSS and I think the authors hated learners.</p>
<p>I failed beacuse I didn't understand the Lucene whick is Open Source(╯￣Д￣)╯╘═╛.</p>
<p>Take care of your life and stay away from people who abuse abstract class.</p>
